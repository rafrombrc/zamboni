Welcome to Zamboni!  This is the current version of `addons.mozilla.org`_,
which rose from the ashes of `Remora`_.

It's forged from (among other things) Django, Jinja2, elasticsearch,
jQuery and a dash of love.

We have some good `install docs`_ if you want to try it out.  We'd love
your help!  You can come talk to us on `irc://irc.mozilla.org/amo` if you
have questions.

If you like what we've done, you may want to check out Mozilla's `Playdoh`_.
We took all the cool stuff we did in AMO, SUMO and our other websites, and
created a base template for new websites.
